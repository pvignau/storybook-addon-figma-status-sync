  <h1>Storybook Addon - Figma Status Sync</h1>
  
  <p>
    This addon translates status information fetches from published components in a Figma component library that use a <a href="TODO">companion Figma community file</a> into <a href="https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/tags">tags</a> for your stories, and provides you with an automatically-generated component status page.

### Useful commands

- `pnpm start` starts the local Storybook
- `pnpm build` builds and packages the addon code
- `pnpm pack:local` makes a local tarball to be used as a NPM dependency elsewhere
- `pnpm test` runs unit tests

### Migrating to a later Storybook version
